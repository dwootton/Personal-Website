How do people use and interact with digital tools?

This is the fundamental question I seek to investigate under the guidance of [Dr. Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com/) at [MIT](https://vis.csail.mit.edu/). I situate my work in the context of data visualization where I study how data scientists use complex interactive visualizations in their analyses. To answer this question, I conduct [mixed-methods](https://dylanwootton.com/projects/chartingEDA) empirical research, [record and model user interaction traces](https://www.dylanwootton.com/projects/reVISit/), and [build systems that enhance user interaction with interfaces](https://dylanwootton.com/projects/altairExpress/).

My research aims to develop computational models of human interaction. Central to this work is the machine comprehension of interfaces, which can enable recommendations that intelligently facilitate humans interact with computers.
