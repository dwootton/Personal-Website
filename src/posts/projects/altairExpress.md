### Abstract

Well designed interactions can make data analysis feel engaging, intuitive, and fun. However, current data analysis libraries are focused on static visualizations that are not interactive. This ongoing project contributes Altair Express, a python library to quickly create interactive visualizations for notebook users.

We build our system to instantiate principles of [instrumental interaction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/332040.332473) in interactive data visualization. Primarily to support the principles of _re-use_, _polymorphism_, and _reification_.
