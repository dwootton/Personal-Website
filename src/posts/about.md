I am a Human-Computer Interaction researcher at MIT CSAIL where I build tools for interactive data exploration and analysis.

My current focus is on developing [a python library](/projects/altairExpress/) that aims to make data analysis feel more creative and effective.

When I'm not busy coding, I pursue my interest in Arctic Sea-Ice research as a Nat Geo Explorer, scuba dive, and volunteer for [LGBTQ+ organizations](https://www.outforundergrad.org/).

If you would like to discuss my research, reach out to me via email at dwootton [at] mit [dot] edu or through my Twitter account [@WoottonDylan](https://twitter.com/WoottonDylan). Let's innovate together!
